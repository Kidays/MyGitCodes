# Syntax: cv2.erode(src, kernel[, dst[, anchor[, iterations[, borderType[, borderValue]]]]])
# Parameters:
# src: It is the image which is to be eroded .
# kernel: A structuring element used for erosion. If element = Mat(), a 3 x 3 rectangular structuring element is used. Kernel can be created using getStructuringElement.
# dst: It is the output image of the same size and type as src.
# anchor: It is a variable of type integer representing anchor point and itâ€™s default value Point is (-1, -1) which means that the anchor is at the kernel center.
# borderType: It depicts what kind of border to be added. It is defined by flags like cv2.BORDER_CONSTANT, cv2.BORDER_REFLECT, etc.
# iterations: It is number of times erosion is applied.
# borderValue: It is border value in case of a constant border.
# Return Value: It returns an image.
