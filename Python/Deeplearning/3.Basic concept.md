## Bias and Variance of Estimator
- Estimate the mean of a variable x
  - assume the mean of x is $\mu$
  - assume the variance of x is $ \sigma^2$
- Estimator of variance $\sigma^2$
  - Sample N points:{$x^1,x^2,...,x^n$}
$m=\frac{1}{N}\sum_{n}x^n$  
$s^2=\frac{1}{N}\sum_{n}(x^n-m)^2$
Biased estimator
$E[s^2]=\frac{N-1}{N}\sigma^2\neq \sigma^2$ 
## Parallel Universes
- In different universes,we are collecting(catching)10 Pokemons as training data to find $f^*$
$y=b+w\cdot x^{cp}$
## Variance
- Simpler model is less influenced by the sampled data
## Bias
- Bias: If we average all the $f^*$,is it clese to $\hat{f}$
- **Underfitting:** Large Bias Small Variance
- **Overfitting:** Small Bias Large Variance
## What to do with large bias?
- Diagnosis:
  - If your model cannot even fit the training examples,then you have large bias
  - If you can fit the training ata,but large error on testing data,then you probably have large variance
- For bias,redesign your model:
  - Add more features as input
  - A more complex model
## What to do with large variance?
  - More data Very effective,but not always practical
  - Regularization
## Model Selection 
- There is yayally a trade-off between bias and variance
- Select a model that balances two kinds of error to minimize total error
- What you should NOT do:
  - Cross Validation
  - Nn-fold Cross Validation
